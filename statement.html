  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>	Always inspired by the prospects of the unknown, Demetri Katsilometes dually explores the self and the lenses it provides to view the world. Exploring the ever-abundant combinations of color, contrast, and composition, Demetri prefers no location over another: urban, rural, natural, or some combination all provide the perfect canvas to digitally alter his captures. To create the main image to build on, he relies on his iPhone 7,for ease and portability. He emphasizes the importance of never settling for a final piece: instead continuing the process of editing post exhibition. There are always eye-catching combinations to be discovered. This approach is not limited to art, but rather in all segments of his life. Forever a student, Demetri seeks only one endpoint: learning as much about the world as he can, and sharing his findings, through his vision.

<p>In order to communicate his thoughts with (ideally) no coherent words uttered, Demetri must first set the visual scene. By instituting daily deep thinking, Demetri is able to mentally align his reality with composition. Being a photographer and videographer, he can walk over 6 miles with his tools to get the right sequences. After a number of shots, Demetri returns to his shy lair and uploads his videos to Adobe Premiere, whereupon he skews all parts of audio by altering bass, pitch, or cutting it entirely. Additionally, images will turn hazy and de-humanized, in order to create a narrative based on Demetriâ€™s internal self, which is his most true self, or at least keys to his true self. The endpoint is to be heard, not by speaking.</p>
