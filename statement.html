  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>	Always inspired by the prospects of the unknown, Demetri Katsilometes dually explores the self and the lenses it provides to view the world. Exploring the ever-abundant combinations of color, contrast, and composition, Demetri prefers no location over another: urban, rural, natural, or some combination all provide the perfect canvas to digitally saturate his images. To create the main image to build on, Demetri relies on his Nikon D3200 DSLR camera. However, if Demetri is in a hurry or forgetful, his iPhone 7 serves as a worthy backup. Demetri emphasizes the importance of never settling for a final piece: instead continuing the process of editing even after the showing. There are always newly discovered eye-catching combinations to be newly discovered. This approach is not limited to art, but rather in all segments of his life. Forever a student, Demetri seeks only one endpoint: learning as much about the world as he can, and sharing his findings, through his vision.
	Demetri’s multi-step vision has no specific process. However, a usual combination of shooting, daydreaming, uploading, sleeping, editing, eating, sleeping, and innerly screaming leads to “the one,” instantly birthing 10+ additional “ones.” His main choice of editing software is Adobe Lightroom: the main source of fun oozing from playing with color, light, and contrast.
